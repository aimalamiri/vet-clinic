# Vet Clinic Database

This repository contains the sql query files for the Vet Clinic database. These queries are tested in PostgresSQL, and you can prepare it for MYSQL and MS SQL as well with some minor changes.

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
